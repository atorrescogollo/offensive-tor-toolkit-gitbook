# Introduction

[**Offensive Tor Toolkit**](https://github.com/atorrescogollo/offensive-tor-toolkit) is a series of tools that **simplify the use of Tor for typical exploitation and post-exploitation tasks**.

In exploitation and post-exploitation phases, the victim needs to access Tor. All of this tools have an **embedded instance of Tor** and they are completely separated from each other. In this way, you only need to upload one file to the victim in order to run the required action.

## How it works?

[**Offensive Tor Toolkit**](https://github.com/atorrescogollo/offensive-tor-toolkit) is written in [Golang](https://golang.org/), a language that stands out for its good performance. Also, [Offensive Tor Toolkit](https://github.com/atorrescogollo/offensive-tor-toolkit) makes use of the following libraries:

* [**`ipsn/go-libtor`**](https://github.com/ipsn/go-libtor): Self-contained Tor from Go.
* [**`cretz/bine`**](https://github.com/cretz/bine): Go API for using and controlling Tor.
